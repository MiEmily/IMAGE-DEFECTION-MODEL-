 **downsampling VS upsampling**</br>sequential downsampling and upsampling is the basis of _**encoder-decorder networks(U-networks)**_, one of the more commonly used image processing AI archeitectures.

**Mahalanobis Distance**</br>
Mahalanobis distance is used to determine the distance betwen two different distributions for _**multivariate**_ analysis. it is used instead of Euclidean distance since Euclidean gives correct results for normally distributed data without any skewness,HOWEVER, the result is wrong for skewed data. To handle this situation, mahalanobis distance is used which takes the covariances of the distributions into consideration. For highly correlated data, the covariance will be high and dividing to covariance will normalize the data. As a result, mahalanobis converts the distributions to standard normal distributions awith uncorrelated varaibles by changing the variances into unit variances and then calculates the distance just like theone that is done with Euclidean distance.
